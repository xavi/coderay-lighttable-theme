### code-lighttable-theme

A theme for [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com) based on [CodeRay](http://coderay.rubychan.de)'s default [Alpha theme](https://github.com/rubychan/coderay/blob/master/lib/coderay/styles/alpha.rb).

To install, use Light Table's "Plugins: Show plugin manager" command. You'll find the plugin/theme by the name of "CodeRay theme".

The theme provides sensible syntax highlighting for Clojure/ClojureScript, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has not been checked with source code in other languages.
